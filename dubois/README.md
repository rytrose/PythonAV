# Dubois Experiment

This was inspired by listening to the Dubois Concerto for Alto Saxophone on YouTube, and skipping back and forth using YouTube's left-right key bindings to 5s forward-back. The chromaticism of the Dubois and the nature of the saxophone made a compelling set of sounds. I needed to start somewhere, so I thought to implement this in python and start investigating OpenCV and visuals in python.
